# Recordr — Project Handoff

> **Last updated:** 2026-08-15 (this session)
> **Repo root:** `C:\Users\Serge\Documents\GitHub\recordr`
> **Stack:** Electron 30 (Chromium 126) + React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, native WASAPI helper in C# / .NET 8 (NAudio)

---

## 1. What we're building

**Recordr** is a Windows-app-style **system audio recorder** with two backends:

1. **Desktop capture** (`desktopCapturer`) — Chromium's screen/window picker with system-audio loopback. Closest analogue to OBS-style "capture a window's audio."
2. **WASAPI loopback** (native) — per-speaker / per-headset capture via a tiny self-contained .NET 8 helper that drives **NAudio's `WasapiLoopbackCapture`**. This is the *true* per-output-device backend **the user specifically asked for** ("Add a 'loopback device' picker that bypasses desktopCapturer for true per-speaker capture").

The modes (inspired by [birdsthings.com Rolling Sampler](https://www.birdsthings.com/)):

* **Rolling** (default, 15-min in-memory cap): MediaRecorder is always on; pressing the hotkey drains whatever has buffered in RAM out to a `.webm` file. Users never lose clips from the past N minutes.
* **Traditional**: hotkey toggles recording on/off; the session auto-saves on stop.

The UI: a single dashboard with a **header HUD** (status pill + buffer-fill bar + VU meter + always-on-top toggle + roll-save button), a **big visualizer** (switchable oscilloscope / spectrum / scrolling spectrogram) adapted from `Audio Oscilloscope & Spectrum Analyzer.html` that lives on the user's desktop (`C:\Users\Serge\Desktop\Audio Oscilloscope & Spectrum Analyzer.html`), a **footer with source picker** (screen/window OR WASAPI device), the visualizer-mode chip row, and a **settings modal** (folder picker, theme, buffer seconds, bitrate, hotkey capture, capture-backend radio, filename template editor + token chips, always-on-top, windowed/unwindowed behaviour). Plus a **toast stack** for save confirmations and errors.

The app integrates tightly with the **Windows tray**: 16×16 procedurally-drawn icon with idle-green / record-red state, overlay badge while capturing, dynamic title `● 0:42` (Windows 10+), multi-line tooltip showing elapsed time + folder + last save, a right-click menu with Show/Hide, Always-on-top toggle, Open save folder, Recent saves submenu (last 5), Settings…, Quit. **Single-instance lock** so a second launch focuses the existing window.

Filename template is fully user-editable with token chips: `{date} {time} {year} {month} {day} {hour} {minute} {second} {unix} {mode} {device} {counter}` substituted at save time, OS-illegal chars stripped.

Hotkey: `Shift+Alt+R` by default, re-bindable.

```

Default `npm run package` fails on this dev box because the `winCodeSign-*.7z` archive extraction hits a symlink-privilege wall (`Error: 1314 / ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD`). Workaround: just use the existing `release/win-unpacked/` (built successfully on a prior run). To re-package cleanly: rerun `npm run build`, repack asar (see "Manual repack" below).

---

## 3. Session history (chronological)

In order, what was actually built this session. Each step has a one-line summary; the file paths and line counts are the source of truth.

### Phase 1 — skeletal Electron app

* `git_status` shows the repo was uncommitted mid-scaffolding of an unrelated 3D pacman app — that's not ours. We worked under a fresh recordr project the user asked for.
* Lifted the visualizer JS out of the user's `Audio Oscilloscope & Spectrum Analyzer.html` reference.
* Built the rolling-ring-buffer + MediaRecorder pipeline so the "Rolling Sampler" mode works.
* Wrote 25 source files (~1100 LOC) for the initial Electron 3-process layout.
* Bumped C: to **out-of-space** mid-install; user gave the green light to "go i clear 3 gb" — installed 420 packages and built clean.
* Wrote README.

### Phase 2 — dev verification

* `npm run dev` boots clean (only a harmless Chromium-DevTools `Autofill.enable` warning).
* Renderer serves on `127.0.0.1:5173`, IPC handshake works, settings file written to userData.

### Phase 3 — WASAPI loopback (user's specific request)

User asked: **"Add a 'loopback device' picker that bypasses desktopCapturer for true per-speaker capture (uses nAudio via a small add-on)."**

* Tried `naudiodon2` — needs native compilation. No VS Build Tools on this box.
* Tried `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` — its bundled binary lacks WASAPI support.
* Found `dotnet 8` (already installed: 8.0.13), and a separate `c:\ffmpeg` BtbN build with full WASAPI.
* Cleanest path: write a tiny **C# .NET 8 console app using NAudio**, publish framework-dependent, ship the apphost + NAudio DLLs as an `extraResource`.
* Spin-up of **one-time `dotnet-install.ps1`** (~430 MB to `.sdk-bootstrap/`).
* Two real bugs hit:

  1. `new WaveFormat(48000, 32, 2)` returned integer PCM, not float. **Fix:** `WaveFormat.CreateIeeeFloatWaveFormat(48000, 2)`.
  2. Stdin-EOF keep-alive exited immediately on `/dev/null`. **Fix:** use `ManualResetEventSlim` blocking, with stdin EOF / SIGTERM / ProcessExit converging.
* Verified end-to-end: helper captured **1.76 MB** of Float32 samples during a 4-second 440 Hz sine playback test; first samples `0.389, 0.389, 0.394, 0.394` matched `Amplitude = 0.4`.

* Wired backend into the app: `src/main/wasapi.ts`, `IpcChannel.loopbackList/Start/Stop/Samples/Event`, preload + useCapture dual-backend branch, settings capture-backend radio, SourcePicker backend-aware dropdown.
* **`scripts/build-loopback-helper.sh`** for rebuild-on-demand.
* `loopback-build/` is **committed** so first-clone users don't need to re-install the SDK.

### Phase 4 — tray icon + filename template (+ user-requested additions)

User asked: **"Add 'always on top' toggle and assign them to the recordr app icon, plus file-name template editing."**

* Procedurally-drawn 16×16 tray icon (no PNG asset to ship) — center dot green when idle, red when recording; cyan halo.
* Window/taskbar icon at 32×32 from the same builder.
* Right-click menu: Show/Hide, Always-on-top toggle (persisted to settings), Settings… (sends `window:open-settings` IPC), Quit.
* Single-instance lock so a 2nd launch focuses the existing window.
* AppSettings extended: `alwaysOnTop: boolean`, `fileNameTemplate: string`.
* Settings modal got a **Window section** + **File-name template section** with clickable token chips (`{date} {time} {year} {month} {day} {hour} {minute} {second} {unix} {mode} {device} {counter}`).
* `save.ts`'s `formatFileName()` substitutes tokens, sanitises illegal filesystem chars (`/\:*?"<>|`), collapses underscore runs, falls back to `recordr_{date}_{time}.webm`, appends `.webm` if missing.
* `{device}` resolves to the loopback-device name OR `desktopCapturer` source name. `{counter}` increments monotonically.

### Phase 5 — tray capture-feedback

User asked: **"Implement a 'now playing' status note on the tray icon when capturing (e.g., last save's filename as a tiny tag)."**

* Tray title `● 0:42` next to the icon (Windows 10+ only), updated every 1 s by a `setInterval` running entirely in main.
* Multi-line tooltip `● Recording 0:42\nFolder: …\nLast save: …` with the "Last save" line auto-fading after 30 s.
* **Overlay badge** (Windows): small red `•` in top-right of the tray icon while capturing — visible without hovering.
* **Tray balloon** (Windows): pops after each successful save.
* **Recent saves** submenu: last 5, click → `shell.showItemInFolder`.
* **Open save folder** menu item, conditional on `settings.saveFolder` being set.
* Renderer pushes capture-state via `window.api.setTrayCapturing` whenever `capturing` changes (`useEffect`).
* IPC `saveRecording` returns `{ ok, path, bytes, fileName }` so the toast in renderer can show the actual filename.

### Phase 6 — packaging attempt + known-failure workaround

User asked: **"buuild tteh electron"**

* electron-builder in standard mode ran into the `winCodeSign` symlink-privilege wall (`libcrypto.dylib`, `libssl.dylib` are macOS symlinks; 7-Zip needs admin to recreate them on Windows).
* Workaround: build in `--dir` mode and ignore the final error (the unpacked output is complete and runs).
* Added `build.extraResources: ["loopback-build/**"]` so the WASAPI helper ships in `resources/loopback-build/` next to `app.asar`.
* Verified `Recordr.exe` launches (3–4 Electron procs, ~280 MB combined RSS).

### Phase 7 — blank-UI debugging (current, incomplete)

User asked: **"it launches but the UI is completely blank lol"**

* Found `app.asar` path bug — re-pack was placing files at `/main/...` instead of `/dist/main/...`. Fixed by packing from a parent dir containing `dist/` so the asar preserves the layout.
* Launched packaged exe with `RECORDR_DEBUG=1` to enable a console-message forwarder + `did-fail-load`/`preload-error`/`render-process-gone` listeners.
* Got the smoking gun:

  ```
  [17504:0815/...:ERROR:bad_message.cc(29)] Terminating renderer for bad IPC message, reason 263
  [rend:gone] reason=crashed ec=3
  ```
* Identified but **did not fix** two issues from the user's report (this is where we handed off to write this doc):

  1. **Pressing Start makes UX go blank.**
  2. **Dropdown menu has white text on white background** (likely `<select>` with `color: white; background: white` somewhere — probably the OS-default unstyled `<option>` overrides our chip styling).

---

## 4. Known bugs / open issues

### 🔴 Bug #1 — Renderer crashes on Start (the "blank UI" core culprit)

* **Symptom:** Pressing Start (or otherwise triggering `useCapture` to bind a stream) causes the renderer to crash. We don't yet know whether it's the **desktop** path or the **loopback** path or both.
* **Evidence:**

  ```
  bad_message.cc(29)] Terminating renderer for bad IPC message, reason 263
  [rend:gone] reason=crashed ec=3
  Renderer process crashed - see https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-debugging
  ```
* **Likely causes (unverified):**

  1. `useCapture` tear-down / bind effect re-runs while capture is active, throwing in MediaStream lifecycle.
  2. The `AudioWorkletProcessor` Blob URL in `loopback-capture.ts` can't be created due to CSP (`worker-src` not in our CSP).
  3. `pickSourceAndCapture` calls `getUserMedia` with `chromeMediaSource: 'desktop'` — Chromium throws / terminates renderer if `sourceId` is invalid or `desktopCapturer` returned nothing.
* **Where to look:** `src/renderer/hooks/useCapture.ts`, `src/renderer/lib/loopback-capture.ts`, `src/renderer/lib/audio-capture.ts`.

### 🔴 Bug #2 — Dropdown white text on white background

* **Symptom:** `<select>` inside `SourcePicker` shows options with white text and white background (essentially unreadable).
* **Likely cause:** `<option>` elements ignore CSS color/background in Chromium and inherit from the OS. Our `<select>` background isn't styled separately for the open dropdown, and the `option` text picks up the page's `color: white`. Need explicit `background: #0d1430` (or whatever the dark theme panel bg is) on `<select>` and the dropdown should also pick up a dark theme in modern browsers — but `<option>` is OS-rendered so we either need `appearance: none` + custom dropdown or to set `color-scheme: dark` on the document so OS menus follow.
* **Where to look:** `src/renderer/components/SourcePicker.tsx`, `src/renderer/styles.css`.

### 🟡 Bug #3 — `npm run package` re-extracts `winCodeSign` every run (symlink wall)

* Already worked around: the hand-built `release/win-unpacked/` is functional. `npm run package` for a clean rebuild will hit this — temporary fix: pre-extract `winCodeSign-<hash>` 7z archives then `touch marker.file` so electron-builder's hash-mismatch re-download logic is short-circuited. The `.asar` is built correctly anyway by electron-builder.
* Long-term: enable Developer Mode / `fsutil behavior set symlinkevaluation l1` (admin required) OR delete the symlink entries from the 7z manually with `7z d`.

### 🟡 Bug #4 — `<button class="chip on">` in viz-buttons likely has the same root cause as the dropdown

* The `:focus` and `:active` states on `.chip` might also blow out the background. Verify together with Bug #2.

### 🟡 Bug #5 — Single-instance lock: error 32 on Lock file

* `process_singleton_win.cc(464)` reports `Lock file can not be created! Error code: 32` on second launch — but the second-instance focus logic still fires correctly. Cosmetic; not breaking.

## 5. How to run / build

### Install

```bash
cd C:/Users/Serge/Documents/GitHub/recordr
npm install --no-audit --no-fund
```

420 packages (~200 MB; takes 30–60 s; needs ~500 MB free on C:).

### Verify it builds

```bash
npm run typecheck     # tsc -p tsconfig.main.json + tsc -p tsconfig.renderer.json
npm run build         # vite build for renderer + tsc for main/preload
```

Both should print `✓` and emit `dist/main/*.js`, `dist/preload/index.js`, `dist/renderer/index.html`.

### Dev (live HMR)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Launches Vite (5173) + Electron with the renderer loading from `http://127.0.0.1:5173` (HMR enabled, DevTools opens automatically).

### Package for distribution

```bash
npm run package       # electron-builder --win portable + nsis
```

* **On boxes where `winCodeSign` extraction fails** (this machine — `Error: ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD`), the `release/win-unpacked/` output is still usable; just zip that up.
* If a clean rebuild is needed with no symlinks, see "Manual repack" below.

### Manual repack (after `npm run build`)

If you don't want to re-run electron-builder (and get the winCodeSign error):

```bash
# Build all artifacts
npm run build

# Repack app.asar with correct /dist/... paths
mkdir -p /tmp/bundle
rm -rf /tmp/bundle/*
cp -r dist /tmp/bundle/dist
cp package.json /tmp/bundle/package.json
node_modules/.bin/asar pack /tmp/bundle release/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar

# (loopback-build/ stays as-is; it's an extraResources sibling of app.asar)
```

### Rebuild WASAPI helper (only if Program.cs changes)

```bash
bash scripts/build-loopback-helper.sh
# OR manually
cd native/RecordrLoopback
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --no-self-contained -o ../../loopback-build
```

Needs .NET 8 SDK at `~/.sdk-bootstrap/sdk/8.0.X/` (one-time install in `~/.sdk-bootstrap/`).

### Debug packaged build

```bash
set RECORDR_DEBUG=1
"C:\Users\Serge\Documents\GitHub\recordr\release\win-unpacked\Recordr.exe" --enable-logging=stderr 2>&1 | tee C:\temp\recordr.log
```

(`RECORDR_DEBUG=1` enables a `console-message` forwarder and lifecycle listeners in `src/main/index.ts` — added this session.)

## 6. Settings file

Lives at `%APPDATA%\Recordr\recordr-settings.json`. Current defaults:

```json
{
  "hotkey": "Shift+Alt+R",
  "saveFolder": "",
  "captureBackend": "desktop",
  "sourceId": "screen:0:0",
  "loopbackDeviceId": null,
  "recordMode": "rolling",
  "theme": "modern",
  "visualizer": "spectrum",
  "bufferSeconds": 900,
  "bitrateKbps": 96,
  "alwaysOnTop": false,
  "fileNameTemplate": "recordr_{date}_{time}"
}
```

Other paths:

* `%APPDATA%\Recordr\DevToolsActivePort` — what DevTools port the last instance bound (used for `--remote-debugging-port` queries).
* `%APPDATA%\Recordr\Cache\Code Cache\...` — Chromium's V8 caches for fast warm-start.

---

## 7. What to do next

In rough priority order:

1. **Fix Bug #1 (Start → blank).** Open DevTools on dev mode (`npm run dev`) and click Start. The blank UI in dev is probably due to a render-side error. The packaged-app crash with `bad_message.cc reason=263` is a Chromium-126 quirk — there's a chance the renderer is sending a malformed IPC reply. Track the actual crash signature. **Easiest debug:** in `src/main/index.ts`'s RECORDR_DEBUG block, add `await mainWindow.webContents.debugger.attach(...)` if DevTools aren't on, OR launch dev mode and look at console. Likely root: `useCapture` effect throws when `pickSourceAndCapture` returns `null` because the source ID is invalid; or `loopback-capture.ts` worklet Blob fails to be registered (CSP).
2. **Fix Bug #2 (dropdown white-on-white).** Add `color-scheme: dark;` to `:root` in `src/renderer/styles.css`, set `<option>` `background: var(--bg-panel)`, or replace the `<select>` with a custom dropdown implemented in React.
3. **Fix Bug #3 (package fully cleanly).** Either enable Developer Mode (admin), or pre-extract winCodeSign archives and mark `marker.file`. Document this in README.
4. **Visualizer should be live at all times, not only while recording.** (user-requested)

   * Right now the canvas only animates once a capture session is bound — outside of that it just shows the `Pick a source and press Start` placeholder. It should be running/monitoring continuously so the user can see the signal before ever hitting record.
   * Implies decoupling "monitoring" (AudioContext + AnalyserNode tapping the selected source) from "recording" (MediaRecorder / rolling buffer). Bind the analyser as soon as a source is picked; start/stop only gates the recorder.
   * **Where to look:** `src/renderer/hooks/useCapture.ts` (the effect cascade that binds stream → AudioContext → AnalyserNode), `src/renderer/components/VisualizerBoard.tsx`, `src/renderer/lib/visualizer.ts`.
   * **Recording indicator:** since the visualizer is always on, recording state needs its own visual cue — make the visualizer element's **border glow neon green, or a nice neon gradient**, while capturing. **Explicitly not red** — the user dislikes the red-border look. Consider an animated `box-shadow` / `border-image` gradient pulse in `styles.css`.

5. **Compact / responsive UI — must survive small window sizes.** (user-requested)

   * Current floor is roughly **790×555** (see the user's screenshot) and at that size the layout already breaks: the buffer bar and `Save last 20 min` button run off the right edge, the visualizer canvas is clipped horizontally, and the viz-mode chip row (`oscilloscope / spectrum / spectrogram`) is cut off past the window edge.
   * Goal: the app should shrink much further and stay fully usable — nothing clipped, no horizontal overflow.
   * On shrink, **the buttons and the main waveform/visualizer must scale themselves down to stay fully visible**, not just get cropped. Ideas: container queries or `min-width: 0` on the flex/grid children, `flex-wrap` on the HUD + chip rows, canvas sized from its wrapper's `ResizeObserver` rather than a fixed width, smaller icon-only button variants below a breakpoint, and collapsing the `OUTPUT DEVICE` label/helper text at narrow widths.
   * Also revisit the BrowserWindow `minWidth` / `minHeight` in `src/main/index.ts` once the layout can actually go smaller.
   * **Where to look:** `src/renderer/styles.css` (HUD grid, board canvas wrap, footer, viz-buttons), `src/renderer/components/HUD.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/VisualizerBoard.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/SourcePicker.tsx`.

6. **Polish tray UX (timer text size, recent-saves formatting, balloon customisation).**
7. **Mic capture via WASAPI?** Optional; user asked for output-side only so don't introduce unless they ask.
8. **Optional: nice-to-have quality-of-life.** Add a "preview" capture-before-record, button to rename template tokens on the fly, an in-app audio meter exoanding HUD on click. **Not yet asked.**

## 8. Reference files (important landmarks)

* **Visualizer source of truth:** `src/renderer/lib/visualizer.ts` — adapted from `C:\Users\Serge\Desktop\Audio Oscilloscope & Spectrum Analyzer.html`. Don't lose the magColor() palette switcher; both themes need it.
* **Renderer's "what's currently being recorded" model:** `src/renderer/hooks/useCapture.ts` — branches on `settings.captureBackend`. The render-loop bug is somewhere in the `useEffect` cascade here.
* **Filename substitution:** `src/main/save.ts` → `formatFileName()`. Tokens defined as `FILENAME_TOKENS` in `src/shared/types.ts`.
* **Tray state machine:** `src/main/tray.ts`. ~370 lines. Has `isCapturing`, `captureStartedAt`, `recentSaves[]`, `lastSaveFlashUntil` — be careful when extending.
* **Single-instance, hotkey, IPC registration sequence:** `src/main/index.ts`.

## 9. Free-form notes

* This was a 6-phase build with a 7th phase (debugging the blank UI) that's **incomplete** when handing off. The two bugs the user listed (Start blank, dropdown white-on-white) are likely the same root cause family, but the packaged crash signature (`bad_message.cc reason=263`) is something Chromium-126 throws on its own — it can be provoked by handlers returning the wrong IPC type, calling `event.preventDefault()` incorrectly, or sending transferable objects with detached ArrayBuffers.
* The user has a real DAW setup (Bitwig, SphereEx Hydra, FL Studio, VCV Rack are listed in package.json's allow-list of windows). Don't change capture-backend semantics without letting them verify their actual recording pipeline.
* Disk on C: is currently sitting at ~94% used. Don't run `npm install` again without first deleting `.sdk-bootstrap/` (~430 MB) and any leftover `node_modules` from sibling projects if you're switching contexts. Run `df -h /c` periodically.
* If you (the next agent) need to verify exact internal behavior: `set RECORDR_DEBUG=1` was added in this session, stays in the source. Just set it before launching the packaged exe.

- make webapp version that can be run out of browser.
- spectrogram doeswnt work , nothing displays . 
- i want like a live waveform display aswell that shows the current like audio thats in the span of time "save last xxx"
  Users can then select parts of this waveform and then drag aand drop it (same as Rolling Sampler by Bird things does)
